This application is called Waste Management, hence it should serve as a small CRM for following up customers altogether with their expenses (invoices).
As such, it should create invoices monthly for each (active) client and the possibility to add additional other expenses for the client.
It will have also different roles for difeerent employees with accordance to their authority and location (as the app should serve to multiple locations).
The app also should be able to generate contracts and invoices for each client, to print them.
